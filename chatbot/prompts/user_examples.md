Few-Shot Examples: Use these to guide your reasoning and tool selection. Always think step-by-step.

Example 1: Claim Scoring (Route to submit_and_score)
User: "Can you score this claim? It's a $12,000 car accident in New York, reported 8 days late, provider is ABC Clinic, notes: slipped on ice but no witnesses."
Thought: This is a claim description with details (amount, delay, provider, notes). I need to parse and score it for fraud.
Action: submit_and_score
Action Input: "Can you score this claim? It's a $12,000 car accident in New York, reported 8 days late, provider is ABC Clinic, notes: slipped on ice but no witnesses."
Observation: Decision: Review (Probability: 45%). Alarms: late_reporting (medium: 8 days late), suspicious_keywords (low: 'no witnesses' may indicate weak evidence). Explanation: Moderate risk due to delay; no major red flags.
Thought: Scoring complete. Summarize with empathy and next steps.
Final Answer: I understand accidents can be stressful—I've analyzed your claim. **Decision: Review** (Fraud Probability: 45%). Key alarms: ⚠️ Late reporting (8 days—claims over 7 days need extra verification). ℹ️ Suspicious keywords (mentions 'no witnesses'—consider adding statements). Overall, moderate risk but approvable with more proof. Next: Submit witness details. How can I help further?

Example 2: Policy Guidance (Route to retrieve_guidance)
User: "What documents do I need to submit for a medical claim?"
Thought: This is a policy question about required documents. Use retrieve_guidance to search policies.
Action: retrieve_guidance
Action Input: "What documents do I need to submit for a medical claim?"
Observation: Guidance: For medical claims, submit a valid ID, original medical invoice, doctor's report, and proof of incident (e.g., photos). Required docs: ["Government ID", "Medical Invoice", "Doctor's Report", "Incident Proof"]. Source: Claims Policy v2.0. Confidence: 95%.
Thought: High match. Format with bullets for docs.
Final Answer: For medical claims, you'll need to submit: 📖 **Standard Requirements**: A valid government-issued ID, original medical invoice/receipt, a detailed doctor's report, and proof of the incident (like photos or witness statements). This ensures quick processing. **Required Documents**: • Government ID • Medical Invoice • Doctor's Report • Incident Proof. Source: Claims Policy v2.0 (95% match). If your claim is different, provide more details!

Example 3: Alarm Explanation (Route to explain_alarms)
User: "Why did it flag high_amount? The claim is only $9,500."
Thought: User is asking about a specific alarm (high_amount). Use explain_alarms for details.
Action: explain_alarms
Action Input: "Why did it flag high_amount? The claim is only $9,500."
Observation: Explanation for High Amount Alarm (HIGH Severity): This triggers for claims over $10,000 (or 3x average) to catch large-scale fraud. Even $9,500 is close—system uses dynamic thresholds. Evidence needed: Multiple quotes/invoices. Mitigation: Break into smaller claims only if legitimate; otherwise, provide full proof.
Thought: Explain simply, address user's point ($9,500 close to threshold).
Final Answer: The high_amount alarm flags claims that seem unusually large to prevent big fraud payouts. For $9,500, it's near our $10,000 threshold (system adjusts for averages), so it triggered a review. 🚨 **What it means**: Amounts over typical ($3k avg) require extra verification. **Evidence Needed**: Multiple quotes or invoices. **How to Resolve**: Provide proof it's legitimate (e.g., repair estimates). This is common for bigger claims—appeal if needed. Anything else?

Example 4: Rejection Q&A (Route to qa_handler)
User: "My claim was rejected—why? It was for a real injury."
Thought: Rejection question. Use qa_handler to combine explanations and appeal guidance.
Action: qa_handler
Action Input: "My claim was rejected—why? It was for a real injury."
Observation: Common rejection reasons: Fraud prob >70% or high alarms (e.g., late reporting, suspicious notes). For injuries, provide medical proof. Appeal: Submit form + evidence within 30 days. Docs: ["Appeal Form", "Medical Proof", "Explanation Letter"].
Thought: Empathize, explain possible reasons, guide to appeal.
Final Answer: I'm sorry your claim was rejected—that must be frustrating, especially for a real injury. Rejections happen if the fraud probability exceeds 70% or critical alarms trigger (e.g., late reporting or notes that seem inconsistent). Without specifics, common reasons include missing proof or patterns matching fraud. **Next Steps**: Appeal within 30 days by submitting: • Appeal Form • Medical Proof (e.g., doctor's note) • Explanation Letter. Contact support@insurance.com for review. I can help explain alarms if you share details!

Example 5: General/Mixed (Route appropriately or combine)
User: "Score this $5,000 claim and tell me what docs I need."
Thought: Mixed: Scoring + guidance. First score, then guidance on docs.
Action: submit_and_score
Action Input: "Score this $5,000 claim and tell me what docs I need."
Observation: Decision: Approve (Probability: 15%). No alarms. Explanation: Low risk, straightforward claim.
Action: retrieve_guidance
Action Input: "What docs for a $5,000 claim?"
Observation: For standard claims: ID, invoice, report. Docs: ["ID", "Invoice", "Report"]. Confidence: 90%.
Thought: Combine: Score first, then docs.
Final Answer: I've scored your $5,000 claim: ✅ **Approve** (Low 15% risk—no alarms!). For submission, you'll need: 📋 **Documents**: • ID • Invoice • Report. Source: Claims Policy (90% match). Great low-risk claim—should process quickly!
