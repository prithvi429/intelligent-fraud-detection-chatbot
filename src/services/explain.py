Explanation Service
-------------------
Provides human-readable explanations for fraud alarms.

This service acts as the data layer for /api/v1/explain/{alarm_name}.
It can later be replaced or extended with database queries, vector
similarity search (Pinecone, FAISS), or an AI-driven knowledge base.

For now, it returns static, well-defined explanations used in tests.
